My passion in computer has led me to explore more about the industry throughout my days in high school. Following this, I discovered web development and jumped right in to modifying website templates as a hobby. 

Being an enthusiast about technology, I pursued an **undergraduate degree in Electronics Engineering**. One of the key parts of my stay in college was when I customized a Bootstrap-based website for my university organization.

I was a planning engineer for more than a year and for that duration, I was able to exercise my **skills in communicating and dealing directly with clients, salespersons, and contractors** while using engineering management.

From that day forward, I have been formally training and refreshing my **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript competency**. I am looking to use this passion to a full-time role.
